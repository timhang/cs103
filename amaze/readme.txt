=============================== Prelab ==================================

1. What data structure will you use to remember which cells have
already been added to the queue or not?

:I will use a 2D boolean array call 'visited'

2. At what step of the BFS algorithm do you have to mark a cell as visited?

:When the neighbor is '.' and it has not been visited before, then I add
 it to the queue and mark as visited.

=============================== Review ==================================

1. Describe your "mymaze.txt" test file. It should have multiple paths
of different distances. When you ran your program on it, did your program 
behave as expected?

: This is mymaze.txt with multiple paths of different distances. My program
  did behave as expected.
